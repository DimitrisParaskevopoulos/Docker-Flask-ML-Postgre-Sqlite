# Docker-Flask-ML-Postgre-Sqlite
The Flask application is designed to provide predictions from a pre-trained machine learning model. After obtaining predictions from the model, the app is configured to save the results to a database.
It provides support for two popular databases - PostgreSQL and SQLite. 
This app provides a flexible and modular structure, allowing users to integrate their own pre-trained models and adapt the preprocessing steps based on the specific requirements of their machine learning tasks. 
It serves as a robust foundation for deploying machine learning models in a production environment.
